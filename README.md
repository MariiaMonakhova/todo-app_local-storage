# Todo App with localStorage
This app was created using the basic model of the Todo App. You can create todo, toggle todo to complete or undo completing, delete todo, edit todo by double-clicking on the todo that you want to edit, cancel editing by Esc key, finish editing by using the Enter key or by clicking on a free space (empty edited todos will be deleted). In addition, there is a possibility to toggle all todos with the arrow located on the left of the input.

Here is the demo version: [DEMO LINK](https://mariiamonakhova.github.io/todo-app_local-storage/)
